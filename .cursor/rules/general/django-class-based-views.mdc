description: Advises using Django's class-based views for handling requests. Class-based views provide a structured way to handle different HTTP methods.
---
- Use Django's class-based views for request handling
- Implement error handling at the view level and use Django's built-in error handling mechanisms
- Keep business logic in models and forms; keep views light and focused on request handling
- All DetailView classes should use appropriate template names
- Use standard Django form handling patterns for CreateView and UpdateView
- On form success: Use Django's redirect patterns (e.g., `redirect()` or `get_success_url()`)
- On validation errors: Re-render form template (automatic with Django)
- Return JSON responses when needed for Alpine.js AJAX requests
