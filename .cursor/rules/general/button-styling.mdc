description: Ensures consistent button styling across all templates using Tailwind CSS button classes based on action type with modern dark theme.
---
- All "Create" view buttons must use the `btn-success` class (emerald-600 background)
- All "View" view buttons must use the `btn-primary` class (blue-600 background)
- All "Edit" view buttons must use the `btn-info` class (cyan-600 background)
- All "Delete" view buttons must use the `btn-danger` class (red-600 background)
- Button classes should be applied consistently across all templates
- When creating buttons for actions, use the appropriate class based on the action type:
  - Create actions: `btn-success` (emerald green with modern styling)
  - View actions: `btn-primary` (blue with modern styling)
  - Edit/Update actions: `btn-info` (cyan with modern styling)
  - Delete actions: `btn-danger` (red with modern styling)
- These classes are defined in the Tailwind CSS configuration and provide modern dark theme styling with subtle hover effects
- This applies to all buttons in templates, including:
  - Sidebar buttons
  - Form action buttons
  - Table action buttons
  - Modal buttons
  - Navigation buttons for CRUD operations
