- Use Django's template system with Alpine.js for client-side interactivity
- Use TailwindCSS utility classes for styling instead of custom CSS
- Implement proper CSRF protection with Django's built-in features
- Use Django's form validation for form submissions
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use Django's template tags with Alpine.js directives
- Use Alpine.js directives for interactive elements:
  - `x-data` for component state
  - `x-show` or `x-if` for conditional rendering
  - `@click`, `@submit`, etc. for event handling
  - `x-bind` for dynamic attributes
- Prefer TailwindCSS utility classes over custom CSS classes
- Use Alpine.js for modal dialogs, dropdowns, and other interactive UI components
- Keep JavaScript usage minimal - use Alpine.js for most interactivity needs
