## Settings

Moved to [settings](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      uv run python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    uv run mypy vgm_source_database

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    uv run coverage run -m pytest
    uv run coverage html
    uv run open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    uv run pytest

### Tailwind CSS Setup

This project uses Tailwind CSS with a dark retro neon theme. To set up and build the CSS:

1. Install npm dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the CSS (production):
   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

3. Watch for changes during development:
   ```bash
   npm run watch:css
   ```

The CSS source file is located at `vgm_source_database/static/css/input.css` and is compiled to `vgm_source_database/static/css/project.css`.
